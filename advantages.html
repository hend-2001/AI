    <h1>Advantages of AI </h1>
<h3><pre>
1-Reduce the risk of accidents in the workplace
Since construction and engineering can be a dangerous industry, some of the riskiest jobs can be replaced by robots. When 
programmed correctly, they can be designed to learn from interactions within it's surroundings and operate in dangerous 
environments, resulting in less work-related injuries. Although automation was originally used to increase productivity on 
construction sites, it’s beginning to prove that the workplace can also be made safer through AI.

3-Not affected by hostile environments
Intelligent robots have the ability to complete dangerous construction tasks. These may include lifting heavy equipment, 
digging fuels that could otherwise be hostile for humans, space exploration and enduring problems that could injure or kill 
humans. Robots can never refuse to do a task, or be distracted by colleagues in the workplace.

4-Can replace tiresome tasks
Repetitive, tedious or dangerous jobs can be completed by machine intelligence. They are stronger and faster than humans and 
can work on tasks 24/7 without getting tired or bored. The human brain can become tired and less focused if worked 
continuously for too long, increasing the risk of accidents in the workplace. Robots will never get tired of what they are 
programmed to do, and can be used where human safety is a concern.

5-Don’t need to take breaks
Robots do not require lunch breaks, holidays, sick days or wages. They can be set to work on a repetitive cycle, unless 
programmed otherwise. As long as the machine is maintained and programmed correctly, it can work without stopping. This 
helps businesses to achieve tight deadlines with 24/7 production, letting operators do the more skilled tasks which require 
a lot of fitness and experience.</pre></h3>
