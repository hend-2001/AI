    <h1>Types of AI ( Theory of Mind )</h1>
<h3><pre>Theory of mind AI is the next level of AI systems that researchers are currently engaged in innovating. A theory of 
mind level AI will be able to better understand the entities it is interacting with by discerning their needs, emotions, 
beliefs, and thought processes. While artificial emotional intelligence is already a budding industry and an area of 
interest for leading AI researchers, achieving Theory of mind level of AI will require development in other branches of AI 
as well. This is because to truly understand human needs, AI machines will have to perceive humans as individuals whose 
minds can be shaped by multiple factors, essentially “understanding” humans.  Self-aware
This is the final stage of AI development which currently exists only hypothetically. Self-aware AI, which, self 
explanatorily, is an AI that has evolved to be so akin to the human brain that it has developed self-awareness. Creating 
this type of Ai, which is decades, if not centuries away from materializing, is and will always be the ultimate objective of 
all AI research. This type of AI will not only be able to understand and evoke emotions in those it interacts with, but also 
have emotions, needs, beliefs, and potentially desires of its own. And this is the type of AI that doomsayers of the 
technology are wary of. Although the development of self-aware can potentially boost our progress as a civilization by leaps 
and bounds, it can also potentially lead to catastrophe. This is because once self-aware, the AI would be capable of having 
ideas like self-preservation which may directly or indirectly spell the end for humanity, as such an entity could easily 
outmaneuver the intellect of any human being and plot elaborate schemes to take over humanity.
The alternate system of classification that is more generally used in tech parlance is the classification of the technology 
into Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).  
Limited Memory
Limited memory machines are machines that, in addition to having the capabilities of purely reactive machines, are also 
capable of learning from historical data to make decisions. Nearly all existing applications that we know of come under this 
category of AI. All present-day AI systems, such as those using deep learning, are trained by large volumes of training data 
that they store in their memory to form a reference model for solving future problems. For instance, an image recognition AI 
is trained using thousands of pictures and their labels to teach it to name objects it scans. When an image is scanned by 
such an AI, it uses the training images as references to understand the contents of the image presented to it, and based on 
its “learning experience” it labels new images with increasing accuracy.
Almost all present-day AI applications, from chatbots and virtual assistants to self-driving vehicles are all driven by 
limited memory AI.</pre></h3>
